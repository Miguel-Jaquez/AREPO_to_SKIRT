Rowan told us: The key file is MCTR_Cfeed_n6r3K_269 which is the Arepo snapshot on a voronoi mesh. I have also included some examples  of jupyter notebooks where I read in data from such files to view and compare with the projection images made by Arepo for visualisation, and extract the refined cells where the resolution is high.

JÃ¡quez: 
    - *I cant extract the sinks properties. *
    
    - I already extracted the refined cell, their properties and make a file in SKIRT format.
